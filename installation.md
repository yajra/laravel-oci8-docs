### Configuration

You can use Laravel OCI8 with **Laravel** as well as **Lumen**.

### With Laravel
Open the file ```config/app.php``` and then add following service provider.

```php
'providers' => [
    // ...
    Yajra\Oci8\Oci8ServiceProvider::class,
],
```
> Note: This step is (optional) for the publication of configuration files.

After completing the step above, use the following command to publish configuration settings:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=oracle
```

### With Lumen
Open the file ```bootstrap/app.php``` and then add following service provider. This step is required.

```php
$app->register(Yajra\Oci8\Oci8ServiceProvider::class);
```

You should also uncomment the $app->withFacades() and $app->withEloquent() call in your `bootstrap/app.php` file.

```php
// ...

$app->withFacades();

$app->withEloquent();

// ...
```
